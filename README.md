# Python Improved

A better Python `.tmLanguage` syntax highlighting definition for [Sublime Text](http://www.sublimetext.com) and [TextMate](http://www.macromates.com). It includes support for both Python 2 and Python 3. Inspired by:

- the original TextMate and Sublime Text `Python.tmLanguage` files
- facelessuser's [Better Python](https://github.com/facelessuser/sublime-languages)
- Djaniero's [Django syntax](https://github.com/squ1b3r/Djaneiro)
- Peter Varo's [Python 3](https://github.com/petervaro/python) syntax definition

as well as a number of my own changes to make things more consistent and understandable. For customized syntax highlighting taking advantage of all the new scopes, use PythonImproved with the [Neon Color Scheme](https://sublime.wbond.net/packages/Neon%20Color%20Scheme), or modify your own favorite color scheme with the scopes below.

## Installation and Use

If you haven't already, [install Package Control](https://sublime.wbond.net/installation), then select `Python Improved` from the `Package Control: Install Package` option in the Command Palette. To use PythonImproved as your default Python syntax, open a `.py` file, then select **`View -> Syntax -> Open all with current extension as... -> PythonImproved`**.

While I haven't yet tried to install PythonImproved with TextMate, I can't think of a good reason as to why it wouldn't work. You could try putting it in the same directory as the standard `Python.tmbundle` package, in the `Syntaxes` subdirectory. Then, just pick `PythonImproved` from the syntax menu.

## New/Changed Scopes

If you prefer to modify your own color scheme, here is a list of new/modified scopes, along with some examples. It's not perfectly complete, but it's a start.

- `support.ipython.in` and `support.ipython.out`: [IPython](http://ipython.org) `In [1]:`/`Out [1]:` fields &mdash; designed for use with [SublimeREPL](https://sublime.wbond.net/packages/SublimeREPL)
- [Django](http://www.djangoproject.com)-specific:
    - `support.type.django.model`: `(meta|models).` `DecimalField`, `EmailField`, `ForeignKey`, `ManyToManyField`, etc.
    - `support.other.django.module`: `django`, `django.contrib`, etc.
    - `variable.other.django.settings`: [`settings.py`](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.7/ref/settings/) options like `ADMINS`, `DATABASES`, `INSTALLED_APPS`, `MIDDLEWARE_CLASSES`, etc. Should be complete as of Django 1.7.
    - `support.function.django.view`: view functions `get_list_or_404`, `get_object_or_404`, `load_and_render`, `loader`, `render_to_response`, `render`
    - `support.function.django.model`: model functions `get_object`, `get_list`, `get_count`, etc.
- `constant.numeric.integer.(long).binary.python`: binary literals `0b00101010`, `0b00101010L`
- `keyword.control.import.python` now contains `import`, `from`, _and_ `as`
- `keyword.other.python` now only contains `assert` &mdash; `as`, `del`, `exec`, and `print` have been relocated
- `support.type.exception.python` now matches any identifier that ends with `Exception` or `Error`, not just the built-in ones like `IndentationError` or `RuntimeException`, allowing for the highlighting of custom exceptions such as those included in third-party modules
- Miscellaneous changes to `support.function.builtin.python` and `support.type.python` &mdash; a lot of personal judgement went in to deciding which word went where (for example, `list` is a built-in function, but it's also a type, so I put it in `type`), so if you have a good reason for disagreeing please tell me.
- [Function annotation](http://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-3107/) support for Python 3, thanks to [@facelessuser](https://github.com/facelessuser).  New scopes added: `punctuation.separator.annotation.python`, `punctuation.separator.annotation.result.python`, `punctuation.definition.parameters-group.begin.python`, and `punctuation.definition.parameters-group.end.python`.
- You can now have comments in multi-line function definitions:

```python
def myfunc(self,            # gotta have self
           param1="value",  # values are cool
           param2=True,     # or False, whatever
           **kwargs):       # you never know
```

- New scopes for bytes, unicode, and raw/regex strings, thanks to [@simonzack](https://github.com/simonzack): `string.quoted.(single|double).(block|single-line).(bytes|bytes-raw|bytes-raw-regex).python`
- Also from @simonzack, highlighting of `self|cls` in parameter strings: `variable.parameter.function.(keyword|language)`
- `comment.line.note.python` is a comment line that contains `(BUG|FIXME|TODO|XXX)` at the beginning. `comment.line.note.notation.python` matches the actual word itself, so you can differentially highlight the word and the whole line:
 
![BUG FIXME TODO XXX line highlighting](http://pigimal.com/img/comment.line.note.png)

- `constant.other.allcaps.python` captures variable names that are in all caps (`OPENING_PORT`, for example), assuming the convention that these are generally treated as constants in the code. This scope does not match `variable.other.django.settings`, so each can be colored independently. Matches `CONSTANT`, `class.CONSTANT` and the `CONSTANT` part of `CLASS.CONSTANT`, but not `CLASS.function()`, `class.FUNCTION()`, or `FUNCTION()`.
- Fixed the octal integers so the Python 3-style `0o123` is matched as well as the old-style `0123`
- Built-in functions like `any()`, `dict()`, `len()`, `raw_input()`, etc. now have their arguments highlighted just like any other function. Many thanks to [@facelessuser](https://github.com/facelessuser) for the regex, and [@FichteFoll](https://github.com/FichteFoll) for valuable discussion. For those working with Python 2, `print` is still a standalone keyword, as is `del`. If you can think of any others that should be as well, please [let me know](https://github.com/MattDMo/PythonImproved/issues/8).
- To facilitate hacking, I'm also including my `.YAML-tmLanguage` file in the repo, which I use for my day-to-day work (I really hate debugging regexes embedded in XML). Install [`AAAPackageDev`](https://sublime.wbond.net/packages/AAAPackageDev) for syntax highlighting, and tools for converting between YAML, JSON, and XML/Plist formats. [Neon](https://sublime.wbond.net/packages/Neon%20Color%20Scheme) of course has great coloring for the `.YAML-tmLanguage` format, and especially the regexes :)
